# 7-Segment-Driver
A 7 segment driver using Boolean logic and circuits 
## Overview
In the first part, we need be covering converting a 4-bit nibble input into a 7-bit output (1 for each segment of the display).
In the Second part, we will be covering how to represent bigger numbers using BCD algorithms and ripple blanking.

# Part 1
This includes the construction of the driver itself and numbers 0-9
